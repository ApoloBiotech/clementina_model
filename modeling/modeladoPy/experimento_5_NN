1. Import necessary libraries
   - pandas, numpy
   - scikit-learn for train-test split and metrics
   - tensorflow/keras for neural network models
   - combat.pycombat for batch correction
   - matplotlib for visualizations

2. Load Data
   - venancio = Load expression data (e.g., in Parquet or CSV format)
   - annot = Load metadata with stress categories, tissues, and bioprojects

3. Preprocessing
   3.1 Filter samples
       - Remove samples with insufficient bioproject representation
       - Keep only high-variance genes (variance > threshold)
   3.2 Align data
       - Match `venancio` and `annot` rows to ensure consistency

4. Batch Effect Correction
   - Perform batch correction using ComBat
     - combat_corrected = pycombat(expression_data, annot['bioproject'])

5. Split Data
   - X = combat_corrected (gene expression values)
   - y = annot['estres'] (stress categories as labels)
   - Split into training and test sets (e.g., 80% train, 20% test)

6. Build Neural Network Model
   - Define model architecture
     - Input layer: Number of genes
     - Hidden layers: Dense layers with ReLU activation
     - Output layer: Number of stress categories with softmax activation
   - Compile model
     - Loss: Categorical Crossentropy
     - Optimizer: Adam
     - Metrics: Accuracy

7. Train Neural Network
   - Fit model on training data (X_train, y_train)
   - Use validation split (e.g., 20% of training data for validation)
   - Save the model for future use

8. Evaluate Model
   - Evaluate performance on test data (X_test, y_test)
     - Metrics: Accuracy, F1-score
   - Generate confusion matrix and classification report

9. Visualize Results
   - Plot training/validation loss and accuracy
   - Visualize confusion matrix

10. Save Outputs
   - Save trained model to file
   - Save classification metrics and plots

11. Feature Importance (optional)
   - Use integrated gradients or SHAP for feature importance
   - Visualize the top contributing genes
